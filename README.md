== Texas Hold'em Poker Bot ==

Bot for the [RoboPoker](http://robopoker.org/) competition. Currently also
contains a modified version of RoboPoker's SDK with some bugs fixed (e.g. the
platform.py file in the SDK clashes with a Python standard module). Later I
will fork it and remove this directory.
